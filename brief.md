#COCKTAILS+MUSIC APP "Open Sauce"
**Goal:** A single page app, built using Spring and React frameworks.
The app allows a user to input the cocktail ingredients they have available,
then displays a list of cocktails they are able to make with those ingredients.
On clicking a cocktail, the recipe and an accompanying song are displayed.

##MVP
The user must be able to input a number of ingredients and obtain a list of cocktails containing those ingredients.

##Extensions
- The user can apply a filter to the list to only return drinks with certain flavour profiles.
- Each cocktail item in the list links to a recipe.
- Each recipe has an accompanying song, record or playlist.

##Advanced Extension
- The song is an embedded audio/video that plays as the recipe is displayed.
- The app can recommend drinks which the user is only missing **one** ingredient.
